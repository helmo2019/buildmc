## Example Data Pack "%{project/name}"

This is an example %{project/pack_type} pack I use to test BuildMC.

The following project info is inserted from project variables:
 - Version: %{project/version}
 - Pack Format: %{project/pack_format}

But what will happen when a variable name does not exist??
Observe: %{variable that does not exist}
